# Data Mining

This repository contains data mining notebooks exported to **HTML** for better visualization.  
GitHub does not fully render plots and interactive outputs in `.ipynb` files, so HTML versions are provided for easier browsing.

Each notebook explores different case studies, combining exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning approaches.

## Notebooks

### Text Mining [English] [[➡️ Browse Notebook]](https://carlos-castano.github.io/data-mining/text-mining.html)
This notebook analyzes a dataset of IMDB reviews to extract knowledge and predict sentiment.
- **Knowledge extraction:** semantic analysis with Word2Vec and topic modeling with LDA.
- **Sentiment prediction:** comparison between a classical Logistic Regression baseline and a transformer-based model (DistilBERT).
It provides insights into both lexical and semantic aspects of reviews, as well as the trade-offs between interpretability and performance.
